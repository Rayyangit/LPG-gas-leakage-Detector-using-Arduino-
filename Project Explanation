We have used a LPG gas sensor module to detect LPG Gas. When LPG gas leakage occurs, it gives a HIGH pulse on its DO pin and arduino continuously reads its DO pin. When Arduino gets a HIGH pulse from LPG Gas module it shows “LPG Gas Leakage Alert” message on 16x2 LCD and activates buzzer which beeps again and again until the gas detector module doesn't sense the gas in environment. When LPG gas detector module gives LOW pulse to arduino, then LCD shows “No LPG Gas Leakage” message. 
LPG gas sensor module's DO pin is directly connected to pin 18 (A4) of Arduino and Vcc and GND are connected to Vcc and GND of arduino. LPG gas sensor module consist a MQ3 sensor which detects LPG gas. This MQ3 sensor has a heater inside which needs some heater supply to heat up and it may takes up to 15 minute to get ready for detecting LPG gas. And a comparator circuit is used for converting Analog output of MQ5 in digital. A 16x2 LCD is connected with arduino in 4-bit mode. Control pin RS, RW and En are directly connected to arduino pin 2, GND and 3. And data pin D0-D7 are connected to 4, 5, 6, 7 of arduino. A buzzer is connected with arduino pin number 13 through a NPN BC547 transistor having a 1 k resistor at its base.
Gas Sensor(MQ5) module is useful for gas leakage detection (in home and industry). It is suitable for detecting H2, LPG, CH4, CO, Alcohol. Due to its high sensitivity and fast response time, measurements can be taken as soon as possible. The sensitivity of the sensor can be adjusted by using the potentiometer.
